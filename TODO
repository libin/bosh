  - auto action that runs on selected line automatically
- advance action [>] auto deletes when action terminates
- edit mode
- pipe preserved across autorefresh/refresh
- --highlight option with a regex or a number for highlighting every nth line
- use fifos for bash -> bosh communication

BUGS:

- --header problem (cursor positioned in header)
- F6 not working
- some /tmp files getting left
- varfiles not getting created on inter-window actions
